PharmRight reserves the right to discontinue Services and/or terminate or suspend this Agreement immediately without notice if Customer fails to pay amounts when due, Customer’s payment method is denied, or Customer or any End User breaches this Agreement.

In the event of any cancellation, termination, or discontinuation of Services, PharmRight will request that Customer or the applicable End User return leased Equipment to PharmRight or to PharmRight’s designee. In such event, PharmRight will provide instructions to Customer, and Customer agrees promptly to return such Equipment using the original packaging in accordance with PharmRight’s instructions.
